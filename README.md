# gonimo - good night monitor 

This is the sourcecode of gonimo, the web based baby monitor. It is currently a
bit complicated to get this to build, you need the jsaddle branch of
reflex-platform, but this is the easy part - you also need to update some
dependencies manually. I hope I can make this easier soon, in the meantime if
you'd liked to contribute, but can not please file an issue (or comment on an
already existing issue) - this way I know there would be interest and this will
become a higher priority! Thank you!

Also currently the reflex build process is based on nix, which is great for me -
our servers are running nix anyway (nixops for the win!), but a problem for
quite a few. Which I fully understand, nix is pretty powerful and therefor much
harder to grasp than stack, if you get gonimo/reflex to build with a stack based
setup please contact me - this would certainly help others. In the meantime, I
will make the nix based setup easier, as soon as I have some time!
